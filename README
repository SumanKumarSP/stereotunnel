StereoTunnel v2.1
-----------------

Stereoscopic Tunnel Effect, for the Hasbro My3D stereoscope, google cardboard,
or any other similar stereoscopic mobile phone attachement.

You can enjoy the simple mono version of the effect in two variants, the simple
texture mapped tunnel and the normal mapped (bumpy) with glowing messages
version.

But if you have the Hasbro My3D, google cardboard, or any other stereoscopic
viewer for mobile phones, flip the stereo switch, to experience the tunnel's
depth in glorious stereoscopic 3D.

This program is free software.
